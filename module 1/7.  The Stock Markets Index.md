# The Stock Markets Index

If we are asked to tell about status of traffic in city. We would just check a few major roads and junctions. If the condition is chaotic at those places, we say that traffic is chaotic, else we say everything is normal. Same is the case with stocks. We just check the major companies in key industrial sectors. If they are cumulatively moving up, market is moving up else the market is moving down.

The few companies that we have identified to check how the market's doing collectively make the stock market index.

## 1. The Index

we don't have to individually look at these companies to get a sense of the market. Important companies are prepackaged and continuously monitored. This pre packaged market information tool is called **Market Index.**

There are two main market indexes in India - 

1. **The S&P BSE Sensex**

>* This represents Bombay Stock exchange.
>* S&P stands for Standard and Poor's, a global credit rating agency. S & P has the technical expertise in constructing the index which they have licensed to BSE. 

2. **CNX Nifty** 

>* This represents the National Stock Exchange.
>* It consists of large and most freqeuntly traded stocks within the National Stock Exchange.
>* Maintained by India Index Services and Products Ltd. (IISL) which is a joint venture of the National Stock Exchange and CRISIL. Term CNX stands for CRISIL and NSE

An ideal index gives us minute by minute about how the market participants percieve the future. The movements in index reflect changing expectations of market participants.

Index goes up when the market participant think that future wll be better. It goes down when participants percieve the future pessimistically.
