# The Stock Markets Index

If we are asked to tell about status of traffic in city. We would just check a few major roads and junctions. If the condition is chaotic at those places, we say that traffic is chaotic, else we say everything is normal. Same is the case with stocks. We just check the major companies in key industrial sectors. If they are cumulatively moving up, market is moving up else the market is moving down.

The few companies that we have identified to check how the market's doing collectively make the stock market index.
