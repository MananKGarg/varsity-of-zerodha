# Clearing and Settlement Process

As a trader or investor, we don not really need to worry about the clearing and settleing process as there are many professional intermediaries who make sure that everything is done seamlessly. Yet it is important to know what happens under the hood to have a sense of completeness in knowledge.

## What happens when we buy a Stock?

All equity settlements in India happen on T+2 basis. We will see what this means - 

### Day 1 (T day)

* Assume we buy 100 shares of Reliance for 1000 rs each. So, at the end of T(Trading) Day, our broker would debit Rs 100,000 + applicable charges from our bank account. So money goes out of the bank account but stocks do not come in DEMAT account yet.
* Broker also gives a 'contract note' which is kind of a bill for our transaction.

### Day 2 (T+1 day)

* This day we can sell the stock. Selling the stock on T+1 day is called “Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow” (BTST) or “Acquire Today, Sell Tomorrow” (ATST). As we are trading the stocks that are not in our account yet, it could be a trouble especially if the stocks are B group or illiquid stocks.
