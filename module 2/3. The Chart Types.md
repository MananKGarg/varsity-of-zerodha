# The Chart Types

We now know that analysing Open(O), High(H), Low(L), Close(C) helps us to summarise the trading acion for a given period. Now, we need a good charting technique as we have to analyse for 4 data points per day.

Some chart types used in trading are - 

1. Line Chart
2. Bar Chart
3. Japanese Candlestick

We will mainly focus on Japanese candlesticks but before that we'll understand why we don't use line and Bar chart.

## The Line and Bar Chart

* **Line Chart** - Closing Price of each day is plotted and then the points are connected by a line. We can simply look at the general trend of the stock at one glance. However, it is also not very informative also for the reason that it does not give much information.

* **Bar Chart** - It's a bit more versatile. It has three variables and represents all 4 price variables. The three components are - 
> 1. Central Line - Top represents High and bottom represents low for same period.
> 2. Left mark/tick - Indicates Open
> 3. Right mark/tick - Indicates Close

For example, assume the OHLC data for a stock as follows:

Open – 65, High – 70, Low – 60, Close – 68 . It looks like

The Chart for multiple number of days looks like -
