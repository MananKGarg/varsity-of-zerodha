# The Chart Types

We now know that analysing Open(O), High(H), Low(L), Close(C) helps us to summarise the trading acion for a given period. Now, we need a good charting technique as we have to analyse for 4 data points per day.

Some chart types used in trading are - 

1. Line Chart
2. Bar Chart
3. Japanese Candlestick

We will mainly focus on Japanese candlesticks but before that we'll understand why we don't use line and Bar chart.

## The Line and Bar Chart

* **Line Chart** - Closing Price of each day is plotted and then the points are connected by a line. We can simply look at the general trend of the stock at one glance. However, it is also not very informative also for the reason that it does not give much information.

* **Bar Chart** - It's a bit more versatile. It has three variables and represents all 4 price variables. The three components are - 
> 1. Central Line - Top represents High and bottom represents low for same period.
> 2. Left mark/tick - Indicates Open
> 3. Right mark/tick - Indicates Close

For example, assume the OHLC data for a stock as follows:

Open – 65, High – 70, Low – 60, Close – 68 . It looks like

The Chart for multiple number of days looks like -

* If the left mark is below right mark i.e. (Open < Close), it indicates a positive day for the market. To indicate that it is a bullish day, the bar is represented in blue colour.

* Likewise if (Open < Close), red colour is used to indicate the bearish trend.

* Length of central line denotes the range of the day. (High - Low)
* It is difficult to see patterns in bar charts and thus, most traders don't use them either.Candlesticks are the default option used by the majority of community.

## History of Japanese Candlesticks

candlesticks originated in Japan and were used for price analysis since early days there. However, the western world was unknown to it. In sometime around 80's Steve Nison accidentally discovered candlesticks, and he introduced the methodology to the rest of the world. He authored the first-ever book on candlesticks titled “Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques” which is still a favourite amongst many traders.

Most of the pattern in candlesticks still retains the Japanese names; thus giving an oriental feel to technical analysis.

## Candlestick Anantomy

* Open and Close are depicted by a rectangular body.
* We will use blue for bullish and red for bearish candlestick.

* **Bullish Candle** - Has 3 components

1. The Central Real Body - The real body, rectangular connects opening and closing price.
2. Upper Shadow - Connects the high point to the close
3. Lower Shadow - Connects the low point to open

* **Bearish Candle** - In this the central real body has inverted ends.
