# Single Candlestick Patterns (Part 1)

The pattern is formed by just one candle (quite obvious). So the trading signal is generated based on 1 day's trading action. Trades on single candlestick pattern can be extremely profitable provided the pattern has been identified correctly.

The length of the candle signifies the range for the day. In general, the longer the candle, more intense is the buying and selling activity. Short candle imply that trading action was subdued.
