# Introducing Technincal Analysis

Now, we should learn about the versatility and assumptions involved in Technical Analysis.

## 1. Application on Asset Types

We can apply TA an any asset class given the historical time series data of the asset. Time series data is information pertaining to price variables namely - open, high, low, close, volume etc. It's like driving a car, once we know how to drive one, we can drive any type of car.

When it comes to FA, one has to for example study Balance sheets, cash flow statements etc in Equity while FA for other commodities is completely different.

But then the things in TA would remain same for all assets.For example, indicators like 'Moving average convergence Divergence'(MACD) or 'Relative Strength Index'(RSI) are used same way on on equity, commodity or currency.

## 2. Assumptions in Technical Analysis

In TA, we don't care if the stock is undervalued or overvalued, the only thing that matters is the stocks past trading data (price and volume) and the information this data can provide us about future movements.

We must be well aware of the assumptions involved in TA. These are - 

### 1. Markets Discount Everything

This assumption tells us that all the unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price. For example, there could be an insider who knows about a big decision a company is about to make and thus he starts to accumulate stocks. While he does this secretively, the stock price reacts to his actions revealing us that the stock could be a good buy.

### 2. The 'how' is more important than 'why'

For the technical analyst, he is not concerned with why the insider bought stocks but is interested in how the price reacted to insider's situations.

### 3. Price moves in trend

All major moves in market are outcomes of trend. Trend is the foundation of technical analysis.For example, the recent upward movement in the NIFTY Index to 7700 from 6400 did not happen overnight. This move happened in a phased manner, in over 11 months. Another way to look at it is, once the trend is established, the price moves in the direction of the trend.

### 4. History tends to Repeat itself

In context of TA, price trends repeat themselves because market participant's react in similar patterns. For ex if the trend is up, people buy out of greed inspite of higher stock prices wheres in down trending market, people sell despite of getting low prices for their dtocks. This human reaction ensures that history repeats itself.

## 3. The Trade Summary

We plot a summary of trade action over time and analyse Open, High, Low and Close from the plots.

> Open - Price at which trade opens that day
> High - Highest price at which people transacted a given trade
> Low - Lowest price at which people transacted a given trade
> Close - Closing price of the day. It is most mportant as it tells us about Intraday strength. If close is higher than open, then we call it a positive day else negative.

Closing price also shows market sentiment and serves as reference point for next day.
