# Single Candlestick Patterns (Part 1)

The pattern is formed by just one candle (quite obvious). So the trading signal is generated based on 1 day's trading action. Trades on single candlestick pattern can be extremely profitable provided the pattern has been identified correctly.

The length of the candle signifies the range for the day. In general, the longer the candle, more intense is the buying and selling activity. Short candle imply that trading action was subdued.

The image gives a desciption of long/short bullish/bearish candle.

The trades have to be qualified on the basis of candle length as well. We should avoid trading based on subdued short candles. Why, we will see later.

## The Marubozu

It's the first pattern we will look. Marubozu means 'bald' in Japanese. There are two types of marubozu - Bullish and Bearish.

Three rules pertaining to candlestick are - 
1. Buy strength and sell weakness
2. be flexible with patterns (verify and quantify)
3. Look for patterns

Marubozu is the only candlestick that violates rule number 3 i.e. look for prior trends. Marubozu can appear anywhere in chart irrespective of prior trend.

* Marubozu is a candlestick with no upper and lower shadow and thus appears bald.It just has the real body. Red candle represents bearish marubozu whereas blue represents bullish marubozu.

## Bullish Marubozu

* We can clearly see that in this, Low = Open and High = Close.
* Bullish marubozu tells that there is so much interest in buying the stock that people are willing to buy at any price in the market. It tells the Bullish sentiment on the stock.
* It doesn't matter what the previous trend was. A marubozu indicates a bullish sentiment.
* The expectation is that the bullish sentiment would remain during some trading sessions.
